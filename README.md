# MWT
Tools for windows. <br/>These tools can help you fix issues and crap that I have experienced using windows 10/11. <br/>


### Note:
Most of these you can make yourself, or change registry files yourself.

# The tools and what they do

## Bypass Win 11 (BW11)
Bypasses the TPM and the Secure Boot check. *This is old, there is now a way to bypass the RAM check as well.*

## Disable Windows Portable Workstation (DWPW)
Will allow you to upgrade Windows freely and use certain features that aren't available on "Portable Workstations." <br/> *This script is for certain scenarios, this is helpful only if you have Windows installed on a USB drive of some sort. Works with Windows 10 and 11.*

## Fix Windows Effects (FWE)
This will fix broken Windows Effects, sometimes my driver crashes causing Windows Effects (such as acrylic) to break. <br/>
This is really helpful as when I tried to fix it myself, there wasn't much on how to.

## Recommendation: OfflineInsiderEnroll (OLIE)
Useful if you want to enroll into the Insider program without a MS account. <br/>
**If you want to enroll into the Windows Insider Dev Channel on a unsupported computer use this.** <br/>
**You can also use registry tweaks to manually enroll.** <br/>

# How to use them
Simply double-click the batch file you want to run. It will always ask for admin. Follow the instructions in the batch file. <br/>
*Certain batch files may ask you to reboot. Make sure to reboot to apply registry changes.* <br/>
You can reboot later by pressing the control key and C.
